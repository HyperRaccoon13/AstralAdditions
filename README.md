# Astral Additions

This mod adds various additions to the modpack [Create: Astral](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/modpacks/create-astral)
Although it will run without the modpack, it is not intended to be used in this way. Certain features may not be accessible in survival mode.

## Custom Music

Create: Astral OST by Hesperyd (ft. XETROO, PINS3Y and myself), breathing tons of new life into the overworld and the planets of Ad Astra.

In total darkness underground in the overworld - Depths

Vanilla music has been mixed in where I saw they fit best.
